Read, as parameters in the command line, separated by space, several complex numbers of the form a+b*I and one operation, in the form of a unioperator (+,-,*,/).

1.to check if the parameters read in the command line, separated by space, represent an arithmetic expression of the form:1N1, JT, where you can find the complex numbers of form +, and that is the given operator.

Example: 2+3^5−6−2^5+Args[0]=2+3^1, args[1]= +, args[2]= 5−6^2, args[3]= +, args[4]=−2+.in case of reading parameters in the command line, the expression of this expression is described as rissa-.

1) you are encouraged to come up with your own design to solve the problem if it is correctadhering to the object-oriented design principles learned so far (see SOLID design principles). A simplistic design (all in a file, without specialized classes...) the one that only solves the problem will be marked with a note 8.
